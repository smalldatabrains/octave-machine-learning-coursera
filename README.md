First steps in the machine learning world back to 2015/2016. What a journey it has been since then.
Recommanding 100% this fantastic course :

Deep dive into :
- classification and regression algorithm
- neural network structures
- gradient descent and backpropgation
- and many other topics

Requires an ok level and comprehension in matrix manipulation. At the end of this course, you have enough knowledge to be able to code you own neural network using basic python libraries such as numpy.
